### 🔹 [Workshop Branch](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/tree/Workshop)

This branch features hands-on Java mini-projects applying real-world scenarios and object-oriented principles.

#### 🍵 [BookBuddy](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/blob/Workshop/BookBuddy.java)

A console-based book management system where users can:

- Add books by title and author
- Display all books
- Search books by author's name

🛠️ Concepts used: `ArrayList`, constructors, method interaction, user input handling

#### 🍵️ [QuizResultProcessor](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/blob/Workshop/QuizResultProcessor.java)

A console-driven quiz evaluator that:

- Accepts correct answers and user inputs
- Calculates scores and assigns grades (A – F)
- Throws a custom exception for invalid submissions

🛠️ Concepts used: Custom Exception (`InvalidQuizSubmissionException`), `List`, encapsulation, grading logic

#### 🍵 [FlightBookingSystem](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/blob/Workshop/FlightBookingSystem.java)

An airline booking simulation:

- Search for flights by destination
- Book flights with flight numbers
- View all passenger bookings

🛠️ Concepts used: Classes (`Flight`, `Booking`), `ArrayList`, string matching, input flow

#### 🍵 [StudentRecord](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/blob/Workshop/StudentRecord.java)

A student performance tracker:

- Accepts names, subjects, and marks
- Displays average marks and grades per subject
- Validates marks between 0 and 100

🛠️ Concepts used: Arrays, conditionals, loop-based validation, method abstraction

#### 🍵 [CinemaTime](https://github.com/GovindSingh3011/BridgeLab_SIPP_Training/blob/Workshop/CinemaTime.java)

A movie schedule and search manager:
