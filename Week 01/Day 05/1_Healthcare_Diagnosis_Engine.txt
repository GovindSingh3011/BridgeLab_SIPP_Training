Start
1. Define interface DiagnosisStrategy with method diagnose(symptoms).
2. Implement strategies:
   - RuleBasedDiagnosis: Match symptoms with fixed rules.
   - AIBasedDiagnosis: Predict diseases using AI logic.
   - ProbabilityBasedDiagnosis: Suggest diseases with probability scores.
3. Create DiagnosisContext class:
   - Has a DiagnosisStrategy field.
   - Method setStrategy(strategy).
   - Method executeDiagnosis(symptoms) â†’ delegates to strategy.diagnose().
4. Example:
   - General Medicine: RuleBasedDiagnosis.
   - Neurology: AIBasedDiagnosis.
5. New strategy (GeneticPatternDiagnosis) can be added without touching old code.
