Start
1. Initialize a Queue with active servers (S1, S2, S3).
2. For each incoming request:
   - Assign request to server at front of queue.
   - Move that server to the back of the queue.
3. Support dynamic server management:
   - Add server → enqueue it.
   - Remove server → dequeue it if present.
4. Example:
   - R1 → S1, R2 → S2, R3 → S3
   - Add S4 → R4 → S1, R5 → S2
   - Remove S2 → R6 → S3
End
