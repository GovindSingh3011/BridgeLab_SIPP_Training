Start
1. Data Structure:
   Map<Zone, Map<Day, List<Reading>>>
   - Zone → Day → List of meter readings
2. For each Zone and Day:
   - Aggregate daily readings.
   - Find maximum (peak load).
3. Example:
   - Zone-A, Day-2025-08-01 → [120, 90, 200, 150] → Peak = 200
   - Zone-B, Day-2025-08-01 → [300, 350, 250] → Peak = 350
4. Generate report: Zone-wise, Day-wise peak load.
